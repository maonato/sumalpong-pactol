#updating ssh keys to servers automatically

#How to use:

#assume that you already have generated a pair of RSA key pair and saved 
#to filename mykey-old.

#open the serverlist file and replace the server addresses to your server address.

#generate a new key and save it to filename mykey-new

#run the rotaion.sh with arguments, if you want to update new keys to server then the syntax will be:

./rotaion.sh update

#if you want to deleteyour old keys after updating then the syntax is:

./rotation delete
